# Front End Developer Test Instructions

Hello and welcome to the Front End Developers Test (FEDT) for iTech Media. The end goal of this test is to assess your skill level in some of the fundamental programming languages we use. Complete as much as you can to the best of your ability.

#### Please make a log of your start and stop time + total time to complete.

Please remember to make as many commits as possible to the repo, so we can see your thought process behind building this calculator.

In the repo, you'll find a PNG image called "calculator.png". This is what you'll be recreating, and you'll need to make it match as close as possible.

In terms of functionality, what you're trying to achieve will be covered in the sections below.





# HTML Section 
In this section, we'll be scoring you based on how you write fully compatible HTML 5 mark-up.

We advise that you build this widget using CSS flexbox. If you're not comfortable using it, then use the next best thing you can think of.

The task for this section is to build the HTML frame of the widget as valid HTML5, as best you can.

# CSS/SASS Section 

In this section you will be scored on your accuracy in matching the mock-up provided to the one you create in the browser. We recommend that in this section you use SASS. We use this on the majority, if not all, of our projects.

If at any point, you get stuck or can't complete it in SASS, please continue in CSS3.

You can find the mock-up in the repo named "Calculator.png".

# Javascript/jQuery Section

In this section, you'll be scored on code structure, accuracy and thought process building the functionality for the widget.

### Complete as much as you can from your own personal knowledge.

1. **Number functionality**
  1. Users should be able to push each number on the calculator using their mouse and it will display on the header of the calculator.
2. **Add, minus, divide and multiply** - Users should be able to enter their operation and be able to perform all of the above actions (**addition, subtraction, division and multiplication)** in order to get the correct result when clicking equals.
3. **Returning an answer** - After the user has put in their sum, pressing the Equal button should then give them the answer. You will update the current displayed sum in the header and display the answer instead.
4. **Clear and start again** - Clicking the AC button should give the "All Clear" and clear the calculator header to 0, and remove any background sums, ready to start a new one.



# PHP Section
 This section will be scored on how well your code structure is and the logic behind your code.

1) When the user clicks the save button on the calculator, the sum will be stored in a CSV file, along with the user's IP Address, date it was added and the browser used.
2) Create a new page called "Calculations.php", convert the CSV file into an array, and output all the info into a table. Should be filtered by newsest to oldest.
